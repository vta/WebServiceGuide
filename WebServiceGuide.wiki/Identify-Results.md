Once you have used the Find Data tools to locate data and the Identify Results pane appears, there are many tools available to you.  They are all in the hamburger button located at the top right of the pane.  Here is a breakdown of the tools.

* **Switch to Table:** This displays the results as a table view rather than as a pane view.

* **Show Buffer Options:** This brings up the buffer options to create a buffer around your selection.  It will then create a new results pane that includes the buffered area.

* **Export to CSV:** Exports the results and data table to a CSV file.  Will separate the layers into their own CSV file in a zip file.

* **Export to XLSX:** Exports the results and data table to a XLSX file.  Creates tabs within the XLSX file for each layer.

* **Export to Shapefile:** Exports the results and data table to a shapefile.  Creates shapefiles for each layer in a zip file.

* **Run a Report:** This option only appears if there is a report available for the data selected.  It will bring up the report options to create a pdf report.

* **Save Results:** This tool is very handy and lets you save the results that are currently in the Identify Results pane.  You can then go back and reopen results or use the tool Combine Results (below).

* **Combine Results:** This gives you the options Add to Results, Subtract Saved Results, or Match Intersecting Results.
    * **Add to Results:** Combines a saved set of results with you current results list.  Once combined, you can then save the combined list as a new results set to export.
    * **Subtract Saved Results:** Remove a saved set of results from you current list of results. If you have two saved datasets that have overlapping data, this will remove the overlapping data and save the new list.
    * **Match Intersecting Results:** Only show results that are in both your current list and a saved set of results.  If you have two datasets, this will show only the overlapping data.
