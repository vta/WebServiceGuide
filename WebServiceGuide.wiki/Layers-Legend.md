###Legend
![legend](https://github.com/vta/WebServiceGuide/blob/master/Images/OtherTools/Legend.PNG)  
The layers pane, or legend, shows all available layers and their corresponding symbology.
* The gray boxes with check marks mean that the layer is turned on.
* Click the plus sign next to the layer to view it's symbology.  If it is grayed out that may mean you need to zoom closer in to the map to turn the layer on.
* The slider to the right of the layer is the transparency slider.  Use this to make the layer less transparent to view other layers beneath it.  Not all layers have this capability.
* Some layers have multiple symbology based on features within that layer.  In the image above, the symbol next to routes that looks like a list lets you know there is multiple symbology.  Once clicked it will expand to show the layers symbology.
