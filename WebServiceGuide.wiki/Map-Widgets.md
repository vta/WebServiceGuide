This widget lets you quickly toggle between basemaps at any time.  This comes in handy if you are looking at search results and don't want to switch back to the layers pane to change the basemap.

* **X/Y Coordinates:** This widget allows you to roll-over the map to see the lat/long location. You can switch between decimal degrees, degrees decimal minutes, degrees minutes seconds, and x/y.

* **Scale:**  There are preset scales for every web service and this widget allows you to quickly choose a scale to zoom to.  Just click the button then the drop down arrow to pick a scale you want the map to zoom to.
