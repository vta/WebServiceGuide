This menu gives you quick access to commonly used tools.
* **Sign In:** Use your windows login, SCCTA\Lastname_firstinitial, to sign in.  This allows you to login and save your map project to your account.  You can then log in and open previously saved projects.  All the drawings and things you add to the map will be saved to your project.
* **Change Visible Layers:** Takes you to the layers pane.
* **Print:** ![printtasks](https://github.com/vta/WebServiceGuide/blob/master/Images/Tasks/Tasks_Print.PNG) Opens the print dialog for creating the print template with legend. The template allows you to choose the page size, output format, resolution (96 dpi, 300 dpi), and map scale.  You can also add a title to the top of the page and notes that will show in the bottom right hand section of the page.  Unclick the "Lock print preview with map" to be able to adjust what area on the map you would like to print.  Click print for the file to be created.

* **Identify by Rectangle/Freehand:** Select either by clicking a point or dragging a rectangle to select data on the map.  Can also enable buffering to add a buffer before you make a selection. This will then select all features within the area you select plus the buffer.  The ability to select what layers you want to identify is also available.  Useful for when you want to view layers on the map, but don't want them included in your selection.

* **Return to Initial Map Extent:** Returns you to the initial map view of the site.
