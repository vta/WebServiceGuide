###Search Bar
![SearchBar](https://github.com/vta/WebServiceGuide/blob/master/Images/OtherTools/SearchToolbar.PNG)  
The search bar can be used to find an address or search for data within a layer.  For example, in the parcel finder you can use it to search for an APN or in the transit service you can use it to search for a bus route or light rail line.  If you don't know specifically what you are looking for then using the Query tool is recommended.
